      <!-- <h2>Backstory</h2>
      <p>For well over 20 years, a close family member suffered excruciating and delibilating pain. Inspite of the pain, he pushed his way to work. Only after extracting fluid from his knee, he was diagnosed and treated for gout.  Even with this treatment, he experienced severe and excruciating pain.
        It got to a point where he was hospitalized several times for the pain.  In the meantime, he was given entirely too many steroidal treatments. Although he did not have much back pain, he had a lot of pain in the ankles and feet.  At times, he said it felt like he was walking on glass.  He also had pain in his shoulder and knee joints. His Achilles tendons constantly bothered him.  Only after a life threatening bout with intestinal issues was he diagnosed with Ankylosing-Spondylitis. What a relief to finally know what was causing so much excruciating pain. 
      </p> -->
      <h2>Ankylosing Spondylitis defined</h2>
      <p>Ankylosing Spondylitis (pronounced ank-kih-low-sing spon-dill-eye-tiss) (AS), also known as Bechterew’s disease is a form of arthritis that primarily affects the joints in the spine. In some people Ankylosing Spondylitis
          can affect the shoulders, ribs, hips, knees and feet.</p>
      <p>
       Ankylosing Spondylitis is an autoimmune disease. It attacks the body’s own immune system. In addition to musculoskeletal systems, patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis can also suffer from inflammation of the eye, skin and/or chronic inflammatory intestinal disease.
      </p>
      <h2>Ankylosing Spondylitis diagnosed</h2>
      <p>A rheumatologist, a doctor specializing in diagnosing and treating disorders that affect the joints, muscles and bones causing pain, swelling and deformity will do a through physical exam as well as bloodwork which will test for HLA-B27.</p>
      <h2>Ankylosing Spondylitis affect on the body</h2>
      <p>Ankylosing spondylitis does not follow the same course in everyone, even among family members. There are some complications or symptoms that are more common than others. An example, inflammation of the eye, or iritis, is common. Uveitis (pronouced you-vee-EYE-tis) is inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye.

      <h2>Ankylosing Spondylitis Treatments</h2>
      <p>
      There are treatments that can lessen your symptoms and possibly slow down ankylosing spondylitis progression, but currently there is no cure. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the medications doctors most commonly use to treat ankylosing spondylitis. If NSAIDs do not relieve the pain, your doctor might suggest using a biologic medication. Biologic medicine is administered by injecting the medication under the skin or through an intravenous line.
