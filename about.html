      <h2>Ankylosing Spondilytis Journey</h2>
      <p>For well over 20 years, a close family member suffered excruciating and delibilating pain. Inspite of the pain, he pushed his way to work. Only after extracting fluid from his knee, he was diagnosed and treated for gout.  Even with this treatment, he experienced severe and excruciating pain.
          It got to a point where he was hospitalized several times for the pain.  In the meantime, he was given entirely too many steroidal treatments. Although he did not have much back pain, he had pain in the ankles and big toes.  At times he said it felt like he was walking on glass.  He also had pain in his shoulder and knee joints. His Achilles tendons constantly bothered him.  Only after a life threatening bout with intestinal issues was he diagnosed with Ankylosing-Spondylitis. What a relief to finally know what was causing so much excruciating pain.
